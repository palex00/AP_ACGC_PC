// Furniture Set / Chess Set goals: the pieces are AP items (AP item id == the
// game's item number), each mailed once. A piece of an active set goal that
// hasn't been received is blocked: nothing else in the game hands it out.
// The goals: the pieces placed anywhere in the player's house (all floors, table
// tops too), with the basement built.
// Reads AP state (received items) and the house, never writes to the DLL or the
// game: the pc_ap_logic.c facade does the mailing.
